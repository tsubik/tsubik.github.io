    After working with over 25 developers, Tomasz is one of my go-to developers.
    By giving him more business background into the why of each user story, he is able to make intelligent
    implementations without me babysitting him.  He is very comfortable with iterating very quickly,
    test driven development and trying out new technologies.
    While his hourly/daily price tag is in the middle to high range, since he is so effective,
    he ends up costing less than a less experienced and slower developer.

    I have many fond memories of working with Tomasz for a few years. What impressed me most was his
    open-mindedness. His work was always solid and delivered on time. No matter how difficult case was,
    solutions he implemented were creative, effective and done with high quality. Beside of creativity,
    I want to emphasize his collaboration and communication skills, thanks to which both team
    and clients remember him very fondly.
