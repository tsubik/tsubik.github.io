I finally found some time to refresh my personal website, yay! To be honest, nothing has changed here for years
and my blog was already long dead. Even if I liked the old design I have decided to make some definite changes, starting fresh is always a good idea.

## Previous design

The previous design I found gloomy and with too many unnecessary graphics elements which could be swapped
with simple text using proper fonts. Lacking support for mobile devices was the next problem. The page was simply not adapting to
many device's screens.

As I am a web developer, I've decided not to go for any existing CMS solution for rebulding the site.
The reason is dead simple. I didn't need it at all. What I went for instead, was a completely static HTML site.
That's all I needed.

So I made a list of requirements for my new site:

* Be static and easy to modify.<br>
  To meet this I'm using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> tool built in Ruby.
  This is a static site generation tool which allows you to use layouts, templates, and many nice features.
  Building site with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> could be a topic for another blog post, though.
  At first, I was trying to play with a tool called <a href="https://github.com/Code52/pretzel">Pretzel</a>
  which is a Jekyll .NET port. Although, after having so many troubles with it, I decided to not use it.
* Have a responsive design to adapt to mobile devices screens.
* Be plain, simple and without any unnecessary fireworks.

I'm pretty sure I met those requirements and I hope you will like my new design.
